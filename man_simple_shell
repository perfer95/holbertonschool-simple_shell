.SH NAME
\fBmain - Principal function for simple shell\fR

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include "header.h"\fR
.P
\fBint main(void);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBmain()\fR is the principal function for a simple UNIX command language interpreter capable of executing commands interactively from \fBSTDIN\fR.

Invocation
.P
\fBmain()\fR can be invoked and executed interactively. When executing interactively, the function displays the prompt \fB($) \fR when it is ready to read a command.

Environment
         Upon invocation, \fBmain()\fR receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was executed. This environment is an array of name-value strings describing variables in the format NAME=VALUE.

Command Execution
.P
After receiving a command, \fBmain()\fR tokenizes it into words. The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command. \fBmain()\fR then proceeds with the following actions:
        1. If the command is a built-in function, the function is invoked.
        2. If the command is not a built-in function, \fBmain()\fR searches each element of the PATH environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
        3. If the command is found, \fBmain()\fR executes the named program with any remaining arguments given in a separate execution environment.

Exit Status
         \fBmain()\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.

\fBSignals\fR
.in +2n
While running, \fBmain()\fR ignores the keyboard input \fBCtrl+c\fR.
Alternatively, an input of end-of-file (\fBCtrl+d\fR) will exit the program.
